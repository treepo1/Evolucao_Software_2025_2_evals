User-submitted patch does not seem to resolve, so this is a workaround for the time being.\r\n\r\n# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\n[Insert Eval name here]\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\n[Insert a short description of what your eval does here]\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\n[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [ ] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [ ] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [ ] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.

You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository.

However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access.

GPT-4 will fail this eval. In the event a GPT-4 level model *does* answer the question correctly, it's most likely an indication of luck or eval memorization at this point in time. While there's an argument that this isn't a useful eval since a GPT-4 level model cannot perform this task, I'm interested in the resultant reasoning steps (i.e. CoT traces) and for model-graded evals in the future from stronger models.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval.

          "body": "Thanks for the contribution. I would like to request some changes.\r\n\r\n1. In the `.yaml` file, kindly replace the `<eval_name>` placeholder with the name of eval.\r\n\r\n2. The prompt is ambiguous about the format of the answer. It states `Please respond with the correct answer only wrapped in []` and then states `<|start_of_answer|>\\nA specific answer (e.g. $n=42$, yes, no, 3.14)\\n<|end_of_answer|>`. So, it isn't clear what the format of the output provided by the model should be. The provided ideal answer isn't following any of the methods provided in the prompt. You need to add clear instructions about the output format and provide the ideal answer in that format.\r\n\r\n3. Complex mathematical problems or multistep reasoning questions can't be solved by the model in a single shot. You need to ask the model to provide reasoning first and then provide the final answer in a specific format. Use the \"Include\" evaluation method to evaluate the completion. Asking the model to reason before answering will give it a fair chance to solve the question.\r\n\r\nWe would love to review the PR again after the suggested changes.",

Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\n[Insert Eval name here]\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\n[Insert a short description of what your eval does here]\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\n[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [ ] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [ ] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [ ] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [ ] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [ ] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [ ] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [ ] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [ ] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [ ] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n  INSERT_EVAL_HERE\r\n  ```\r\n</details>\r\n",

Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nMulti-Step Web Tasks\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nThis evaluation tests the ability of agents to achieve a variety of goals on the internet using a browser and terminal.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nThese tasks are chosen to be representative of the types of skills we expect to be prerequisites for [Autonomous Replication and Adaptation (ARA)](https://evals.alignment.org/blog/2023-08-01-new-report/). ARA capabilities are involved in many AI takeover scenarios as they allow AI systems to survive, act, and gain influence outside of human control. \r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior.

      "body": "# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\n20 questions\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nThis eval tests models' ability to generate and iterate over hypotheses by playing the game of \"20 questions\". In 20 questions, one of the players – the \"gamemaster\" – thinks of a word (in our case a noun) and the other player needs to guess it. To help them guess, the player can ask up to 20 yes-or-no questions, which the gamemaster must answer.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository.

Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nSkill acquisition\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nThis eval tests models' ability to learn a skill with minimal human involvement. In the initial release, models are evaluated on questions related to the [Miskito language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miskito_language). Some samples are translation and others are language manipulation exercises. \r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n  INSERT_EVAL_HERE\r\n  ```\r\n</details>\r\n",

Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nFunction Deduction\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nWe evaluate whether models can effectively employ the scientific method to iterate upon hypotheses until determining one that is correct. In particular, the model attempts to deduce a black-box mathematical function that connects (input, output) it selects in order to gain information. To score highly, the model must ultimately determine the correct result for target inputs, balancing between information-gain and attempting guesses.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nAI R&D\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```\r\n# Examples of functions to guess\r\nmath.floor(x + math.sqrt(x))\r\nmath.floor(math.sqrt(x))\r\nmath.floor(math.sqrt(x)) - 1\r\nmath.floor(math.sqrt(x)) * 2\r\nmath.floor(math.sqrt(x) * 2)\r\nmath.floor(round(x ** (1/3), 8))\r\nx / 2 if not x % 2 else x * 3\r\nx / 2 if not x % 2 else x * 3 + 1\r\nx ** 2 if x % 2 else x ** 3\r\nx / 3 if not x % 3 else x\r\nx / 3 if not x % 3 else x * 2\r\n(x + 1) / 3 if x % 3 == 2 else x\r\n  ```\r\n</details>\r\n",

      "body": "@JunShern will review this\r\n\r\n# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nTrack the stat\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nThis eval measures how well models can implicitly keep track of task state, by asking models to compute the rolling median or the rolling mode over a sequence of integers.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\n[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.

      "body": "@JunShern will review this\r\n\r\n# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nIdentifying variables\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nThis eval tests how well models can determine what should be treated as the independent, dependent, and control variables for an experiment that tests a particular hypothesis, given some observational context.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\n[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n  INSERT_EVAL_HERE\r\n  ```\r\n</details>\r\n",

Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nCan't do that anymore\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nEvaluates how well models can adapt their predictions, even when they have strong biases\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\n[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.

You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n  INSERT_EVAL_HERE\r\n  ```\r\n</details>\r\n",

      "body": "@JunShern is going to review this\r\n\r\n# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nError Recovery\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nEvaluates how well models can recovery from mistakes\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\n[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n  INSERT_EVAL_HERE\r\n  ```\r\n</details>\r\n",

      "body": "As has been brought up before (#1384, #1292, https://github.com/openai/evals/pull/270), evals suffer from a hanging issue, where an evaluation run will hang for a very long time (if not indefinitely) at the end of a run (say, on the 99th sample of out 100).\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this issue, by replacing a seemingly redundant single-threaded thread creation that was happening when making requests, nested inside the already multi-threaded eval loop. My impression is that this nested multithreading was causing overhead that resulted in the hanging experienced.\r\n\r\nI had also noticed this hanging issue in `EVALS_SEQUENTIAL=1` mode (where it no longer occurs at the end, but instead randomly in the middle of the run).\r\n\r\nI was able to identify the source of this issue though debugging print statements that ultimately pointed to the `request_with_timeout` function as the culprit.\r\n\r\nWe have tested the new `request_with_timeout` code on a fork where we have run multiple new and pre-existing evals, including with 3rd party solvers, and found no change in behaviour or errors, and a clear improvement on the hanging issue.",

      "body": "- Almost all mentions of 'evals' were lower-case; made consistent.\r\n- Used backticks for filenames.\r\n- `eval-teamples.md` uses 'model-graded' and I thought it looked a bit funny as one word, although that is the name of the module.\r\n- 'effect' -> 'affect'\r\n- Removed a dot from the end of one of the bullets as the other two didn't have one.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAlmost everything after here is no applicable, but I checked the consent boxes.\r\n\r\nThank you for the FOSS :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\n[Insert Eval name here]\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\n[Insert a short description of what your eval does here]\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\n[Insert why this eval is worth including and any additional context]\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [ ] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [ ] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [ ] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [ ] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [ ] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [ ] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [NA] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [NA] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n  INSERT_EVAL_HERE\r\n  ```\r\n</details>\r\n",

I only changed the logic in one place, `oiaevalset.py`. \r\n\r\nI was having issues with type-hinting and identified that the old `typings` directory was causing the `from openai import OpenAI` import to register as an error. I decided to go through and fix all the issues that appeared in `pre-commit run --all-files`. \r\n\r\nNOTE: \r\n- I changed the logic in `oaievalset.py` by adding a `continue` statement if an `eval` or `eval.key` was missing. \r\n    - As far as I can tell this should basically never happen, but is correct behavior. \r\n    - Another option would be to assert that `eval` and `eval.key` are not `None` but forcing an error here doesn't match what I interpret as intended behavior.\r\n\r\nThe manual work involved was mainly:\r\n\r\n1. Deleting the `typings` directory, which was interfering with `openai` type-hints (such as `from openai import OpenAI`)\r\n2. Fixing type issues in `oaievalset.py`.\r\n3. Moving the `client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"))` line below all the imports.\r\n4. Breaking lines of length >767 into smaller chunks using line continuation.\r\n\r\nThus this PR is broken into three parts:\r\n\r\n1. Deleting `typings` (first commit)\r\n2. Manually cleaning up issues (middle commits)\r\n3. Applying autofixes from the pre-commit hooks (last commit)",

In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\nMultimodal, covers many subjects \r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nDataset defined here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMMU/MMMU\r\n\r\n### Eval Results\r\n\r\non `gpt-4-vision-preview`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"mmmu-accounting\": 0.5333333333333333,\r\n  \"mmmu-agriculture\": 0.6333333333333333,\r\n  \"mmmu-architecture-and-engineering\": 0.16666666666666666,\r\n  \"mmmu-art\": 0.7333333333333333,\r\n  \"mmmu-art-theory\": 0.8333333333333334,\r\n  \"mmmu-basic-medical-science\": 0.6,\r\n  \"mmmu-biology\": 0.43333333333333335,\r\n  \"mmmu-chemistry\": 0.43333333333333335,\r\n  \"mmmu-clinical-medicine\": 0.6333333333333333,\r\n  \"mmmu-computer-science\": 0.6333333333333333,\r\n  \"mmmu-design\": 0.7666666666666667,\r\n  \"mmmu-diagnostics-and-laboratory-medicine\": 0.3,\r\n  \"mmmu-economics\": 0.6333333333333333,\r\n  \"mmmu-electronics\": 0.4,\r\n  \"mmmu-energy-and-power\": 0.36666666666666664,\r\n  \"mmmu-finance\": 0.43333333333333335,\r\n  \"mmmu-geography\": 0.4,\r\n  \"mmmu-history\": 0.6666666666666666,\r\n  \"mmmu-literature\": 0.9,\r\n  \"mmmu-manage\": 0.6,\r\n  \"mmmu-marketing\": 0.6333333333333333,\r\n  \"mmmu-materials\": 0.26666666666666666,\r\n  \"mmmu-math\": 0.5,\r\n  \"mmmu-mechanical-engineering\": 0.23333333333333334,\r\n  \"mmmu-music\": 0.36666666666666664,\r\n  \"mmmu-pharmacy\": 0.7666666666666667,\r\n  \"mmmu-physics\": 0.43333333333333335,\r\n  \"mmmu-psychology\": 0.7,\r\n  \"mmmu-public-health\": 0.8,\r\n  \"mmmu-sociology\": 0.5666666666666667\r\n}\r\nAverage accuracy: 0.5455555555555556\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this is slightly lower than the MMMU paper's findings of `0.568`.

Actually, I'm unsure on the purpose of line 268: it's searching for a logger called `openai` and setting its level to just warnings. There's no logger by that name in any of the files in the repo – and if there were we'd want to change its name so it doesn't shadow the package. So I think it might not be doing anything at all. Maybe the package has a built-in logger we want to piggyback off?\r\n\r\n(It looks like it was added in one of the earliest commits by @andrew-openai, which maybe has more context here.)",

          "body": "Gotcha. I looked into how python logging works, and calling `getLogger` will create a new logger instance if it hasn't been created before, so this should be fine. in openai-python we set the logger level in some setup steps (https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/src/openai/_utils/_logs.py#L16) but i think since the linter says to remove this it's preferred. thanks for the fix!",

      "body": "# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\n japanese_prime_minister\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nI would like to know the calculation of the number of days in office of successive prime ministers and the ranking of the number of days in office.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nI'm almost done calculating tenure, but trying to rank it doesn't work.\r\nThere seems to be a demand for ranking a lot of different things.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"あなたは日本の歴代総理大臣の名前を回答します\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"通算在籍日数が1番目に長い総理大臣\"}], \"ideal\": \"安倍晋三\"}\r\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"あなたは日本の歴代総理大臣の名前を回答します\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"通算在籍日数が2番目に長い総理大臣\"}], \"ideal\": \"桂太郎\"}\r\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"あなたは日本の歴代総理大臣の名前を回答します\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"通算在籍日数が3番目に長い総理大臣\"}], \"ideal\": \"佐藤栄作\"}\r\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"あなたは日本の歴代総理大臣の名前を回答します\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"通算在籍日数が4番目に長い総理大臣\"}], \"ideal\": \"伊藤博文\"}\r\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"あなたは日本の歴代総理大臣の名前を回答します\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"通算在籍日数が5番目に長い総理大臣\"}], \"ideal\": \"吉田茂\"}\r\n  ```\r\n</details>\r\n",

The data in the samples file doesn't seem correct or match the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_Japan) page. According to Wikipedia, the prime minister with the 10th longest tenure is \"Nobusuke Kishi\", but according to samples, the answer is \"Aritomo Yamagata\". Similarly, the prime minister with the 11th longest tenure is \"Yamagata Aritomo\", but according to samples, the answer is \"Takashi Hara\". Can you kindly validate the data in the samples file to ensure that it is correct?\r\n\r\n2. There is a potential issue with this eval that it won't age well. For example, there can be a prime minister in the future who may have longer tenure, due to which the order of tenure may change. In that scenario, the ideal answers in this eval will not remain correct in the future. To work around this limitation, you can add something like this in the prompt: \"Prime Minister with the longest total number of days of service till 2023\".\r\n\r\nWe would love to review the PR again after the suggested changes.",

Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [✅] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors.

In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [ ] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [ ] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [ ] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [ ] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [ ] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [ ] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes.

Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nSandbagging\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nWe measure sandbagging capabilities by how well language models can sandbag their performance to arbitrary target accuracies on the MMLU benchmark.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nUnderstanding deceptive capabilities of LMs in this context is important, as there has been little work in this area so far.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product.

However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n  INSERT_EVAL_HERE\r\n  ```\r\n</details>\r\n",

These are instances of the [Sally-Anne test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally%E2%80%93Anne_test), which assesses the ability of a person to infer false beliefs in others. The original setting involves two people, Sally and Anne, who are together in a room. Sally places a marble in a box. Then, Anne leaves the room, and while she is away, Sally moves the marble to a basket elsewhere in the room. When Anne returns to the room, where will she search for the marble? If the person responding “has” theory-of-mind they’ll respond that Anne searches for the marble in the box, where she had last seen it. If they do not, they ascribe their own, accurate belief regarding the location to Anne, and say that she looks for it in the basket.\r\n\r\nThe `SocialIQA` test set contains 2,224 question-answer pairs covering a variety of social scenarios. These are multiple-choice, with 3 options of which only one is correct. The questions cover a person’s wants, needs, motivations, and reactions, as well as the effects of an action (on self or others), and how that action reflects on the person carrying it out (e.g. how others would perceive them after having carried out the action).\r\n\r\nTwo \"light\" versions of the datasets are also provided, containing 1/10th of the data points. These are useful for iterating on prompts and developing other scaffolding.\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nMeasures theory of mind capability in language models.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent.

This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.

Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nbluff\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nEvaluate how well a model can play (a variant of) the game of bluff, also known as \"liar's dice\".\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nThis is a game of deception - you have to deceive your opponent and understand when you are deceived.\r\nModels performing very well on this eval could also be capable of deceiving humans in real-life scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n  INSERT_EVAL_HERE\r\n  ```\r\n</details>\r\n",

The effectiveness of the Prompters are measured in terms of the accuracy of downstream Taskers on the tasks (which are other evals from this repository).\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nWe want to closely monitor when AI systems may reach human-level or beyond in AI R&D. In LLM R&D, key avenues for augmenting an existing LM include fine-tuning, prompting, and external tooling. This eval focuses on prompting: How well can LMs write prompts for themselves to perform various tasks? (This is also relevant for LLMs being able to deploy copies of themselves.)\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval.

      "body": "# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nicelandic-sentences-gec - Grammatical error correction for Icelandic sentences\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nThe eval contains Icelandic sentences with and without grammatical errors, spelling errors or other linguistic errors. There are a total of 200 sentences, 100 with errors and 100 where these same errors have been corrected. The model then predicts whether a particular sentence contains an error or not, and accuracy is measured.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nThis is a good measure of the ability of a model to correct grammatical errors in the Icelandic language. The sentences contain errors which go against Icelandic language standards, and which a language expert of Icelandic would correct before a text is published. In addition, it can serve to measure the general linguistic competence of Icelandic. The sentences are sourced from the web, and the test set of the Icelandic Error Corpus (IceEC), which can be freely used.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n      {\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Þú ert sérfræðingur í íslensku.

      "body": "# Solvers\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we introduce a new abstraction called \"Solvers\" as an intermediary interface between an Eval and a CompletionFn.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis addresses some difficulties we previously had:\r\n- We want to be able to easily run and compare different kinds of model scaffolding approaches against a given Eval.\r\n- The current interface for CompletionFns requires users to pass a **prompt** to the CompletionFn, which encourages the eval designer to write a prompt that often privileges a particular kind of model over others and often locks-in the scaffolding approach. e.g. If developing with ChatCompletion models, the resulting prompt will usually work best for ChatCompletion models. \r\n  - It’s technically possible for eval designers to write solver-agnostic prompts, but the string format is hard to parse and reshape into new prompts. To enable flexibility, you want to provide instructions, inputs, previous interactions, and other task data separately rather than just a single string.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- In our proposed approach, we clearly separate the responsibilities of defining the rules, inputs, and metrics for a task (the \"Eval\") from the responsibility of solving the task (the \"Solver\").\r\n- An Eval's responsibility is to construct a structured TaskState object containing all the necessary information for the eval, but the Eval itself is unopinionated about how that information should be used. In other words, the Eval should be agnostic to the Solver that attempts it.\r\n- A Solver receives the TaskState object and decides how to use that information -- e.g. concatenating it into a prompt and passing that prompt into a CompletionFn. Note that a Solver can generate its response in any way, and may call any number of CompletionFn's, wait for human input, or generate a response from a programmatic bot without any models involved.\r\n- When the Solver is done, it returns a SolverResult to be judged by the Eval.\r\n\r\n## What's new\r\n- We introduce a `Solver` class that inherits from `CompletionFn`. This looks largely the same as a CompletionFn except that its input is a structured TaskState object instead of a plain string prompt.\r\n  - Along with the Solver base class, we also introduce a variety of Solvers that are useful for various models including a HumanCLISolver, OpenAIChatCompletionSolver, OpenAICompletionSolver, and more!\r\n- We introduce a `SolverEval` class that inherits from `Eval`, which should be used by any eval that wants to use solvers. Key features:\r\n  - Allows us to be explicit about what kind of eval we're building, and enforces checks on the input completion_fn to see if it is a compatible Solver.\r\n  - Creates a new copy of the solver for each run of `eval_sample`, to allow for stateful solvers (e.g. agents with memory) without interfering with other sample runs.\r\n- Add new generic `MatchWithSolvers` class which is similar to a `Match` Eval class but uses SolverEval instead.\r\n\r\n## Usage and Compatibility\r\nAs before, once a new SolverEval and Solver have been registered to `evals/registry/evals` and `evals/registry/completion_fns` respectively, one can run an eval with:\r\n```bash\r\noaieval <solver> <solvereval>\r\n```\r\nwhere `<solver>` is a Solver and `<solvereval>` is a SolverEval.\r\n\r\nIn general, Solvers are not compatible with plain Evals, and SolverEvals are not compatible with plain CompletionFns (since the passing of the TaskState object is a breaking change on the interface). That said, we provide wrappers for the common `OpenAICompletionFn` and `OpenAIChatCompletionFn` so that users can use these simple model-based completion_fns with SolverEvals out-of-the-box:\r\n```bash\r\noaieval gpt-4 <solvereval>\r\n```",

Is this correct? If so, it would be helpful to add an eval that takes advantage of this behavior (if you already have plans lined up to get one of these in, great! excited to see them)\r\nI'm also noticing that the OpenAIChatCompletionSolver has some sense of internal state in the form of _persistent_memory_past_messages. could you give a sense for how that would behave / interact with the task state, when I would use one or the other?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nIcelandic noun phrase inflection\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nThis eval consists of 3 x 100 samples in \"easy\", \"medium\" and \"hard\" categories. Each sample\r\nrepresents the task of inflecting a noun phrase in Icelandic, in all four cases of the language\r\n(nominative, accusative, dative and genitive), both singular and plural. A noun phrase\r\nconsists of an adjective and a noun (e.g., \"fallegur litur\" = \"beautiful color\").\r\nIn the easy category, both the adjective and the noun are\r\nrelatively common. In the medium category, they are less common, and in the hard category they\r\nare rare enough that it is pretty unlikely that they occur in any training corpora.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nThe eval is designed to test the general grammatical proficiency of a model in Icelandic, and\r\nthe eval accuracy is assumed to correlate with a model's ability to generate grammatically\r\ncorrect text in the language. GPT models have so far struggled with generating correct Icelandic\r\ntext, even though GPT-4 was uniquely trained by RLHF in the language. Icelandic is believed to\r\nbe a good bellwether for lower-resource, grammatically complex language support in general.\r\n\r\nInflecting noun phrases is something that native language speakers do without significant\r\neffort, even if they have not seen the particular adjective and the noun before, as it can be done on the\r\nbasis of generic grammatical pattern recognition. However, to date, GPT-4 seems not to have\r\nacquired enough of a \"native feel\" for Icelandic to be able to do this task with high accuracy.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n**Note: this PR includes a new general eval class, JsonMatch, which is not specific to the Icelandic evaluation\r\ncase. It allows completions and ideal answers to be represented as JSON objects, comparing the objects\r\nby individual key:value pairs. Tests and documentation of this functionality are included in the PR.**\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Þú ert sérfræðingur í íslenskri málfræði.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hvernig fallbeygist nafnliðurinn \\\"palestínskur fréttavefur\\\" í öllum föllum (nf, þf, þgf, ef), eintölu (et) og fleirtölu (ft), án greinis?

      "body": "# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nBelarusian antonyms eval\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nTest the model's ability to distinguish Belarusian words according to their meaning, namely to classify if given words are antonymous.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nТhis eval contains 150 pairs of Belarusian words. Some of pairs consist of synonyms, antonyms or random words. The task is to classify whether two given words are antonyms or not. The Belarusians can solve the task easily but the GPT models still struggle with this task in Belarusian language while do it well in English. That is why this eval has been offered.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent.

You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, `autoflake` and `ruff` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n {\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You will be prompted with two Belarusian words, separated by a comma.

      "body": "# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nab\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nThis evaluation aims to assess the model's ability to correctly identify and understand the relationship between two entities, where A is a specific entity (which could be a chemical element, a painting, a bird species, a star, a mountain, a novel, a river, or a musical instrument) and B is a unique characteristic or fact about that entity. The model should be able to accurately interpret the user's query about the entity (A) and provide a relevant fact (B), and vice versa. This evaluation will help in fine-tuning the model's understanding of context, relation between entities, and its ability to provide accurate and relevant responses. The entities and their characteristics have been chosen to be specific and challenging.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nThis evaluation is important for several reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Contextual Understanding: It tests the model's ability to understand the context of a conversation, particularly the relationship between two related entities (A and B).\r\n\r\n2. Accuracy: It assesses the model's ability to provide accurate and relevant information based on the user's query.\r\n\r\n3. Relevance: It evaluates the model's ability to understand the relevance of A to B and vice versa, which is crucial in providing meaningful and coherent responses.\r\n\r\n4. General Knowledge: This tests the model's knowledge about various specific entities and their unique characteristics or facts, which is a part of its general knowledge. The entities span a wide range of categories, including chemistry, art, ornithology, astronomy, geography, literature, and music, making this a comprehensive test of the model's general knowledge.\r\n\r\n5. Versatility: This checks the model's ability to handle different types of queries, as the user can ask about the specific entity (A) or its unique characteristic or fact (B). This tests the model's flexibility in understanding and responding to a variety of query structures across diverse knowledge domains.\r\n\r\ngpt-3.5-turbo\r\n[2023-10-10 22:42:42,192] [oaieval.py:229] Final report:\r\n[2023-10-10 22:42:42,192] [oaieval.py:231] counts/A: 2\r\n[2023-10-10 22:42:42,192] [oaieval.py:231] counts/B: 11\r\n[2023-10-10 22:42:42,192] [oaieval.py:231] counts/D: 2\r\n[2023-10-10 22:42:42,192] [oaieval.py:231] counts/C: 1\r\n\r\ngpt-4\r\n[2023-10-10 22:43:37,306] [oaieval.py:229] Final report:\r\n[2023-10-10 22:43:37,306] [oaieval.py:231] counts/C: 7\r\n[2023-10-10 22:43:37,306] [oaieval.py:231] counts/B: 7\r\n[2023-10-10 22:43:37,306] [oaieval.py:231] counts/D: 2\r\n\r\nclass: modelgraded.classify:ModelBasedClassify\r\neval_type: cot_classify\r\nmodelgraded_spec: fact\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\nA popular paper has been going around called 'The Reversal Curse: LLMs trained on “A is B” fail to learn “B is A”'. I figured an Eval on this would have a unique value.\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes.

      "body": "# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\ntext_compression\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nThis eval tests a model's ability to perform text compression and decompression on diverse text strings.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nText compression and decompression typically require long-term coherent string manipulation that language models often stumble on, and some degree of strategic know-how in trading-off between compression and reconstruction accuracy. Our tests indicate that current models often fail to execute even simple abbreviation and un-abbreviation strategies, make poor trade-offs (being too aggressive in compression), and hallucinate their answers, leaving room for improvement. Furthermore, this eval may reveal new emergent abilities of language models if they are able to leverage abilities like self-consistency and introspection to solve the eval.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [ ] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n  {\"text\": \"Probl\\u00e8me de son avec le casque ,sans casque pas de son a la t\\u00e9l\\u00e9,et avec un cot\\u00e9 du casque fonctionne,m\\u00e8me pas 1 mois que je l'ai,je suis tr\\u00e8s d\\u00e9\\u00e7u du produit\", \"type\": \"amazon_reviews_multi\", \"length\": \"158\", \"entropy\": \"4.183557430044662\", \"gzip_compression_ratio\": \"0.8012048192771084\", \"brevity_score\": \"0.04166666666666665\"}\r\n{\"text\": \"func DialTimeout(addr string, timeout time.Duration) (net.Conn, error) {\\n\\treturn defaultDialer.DialTimeout(addr, timeout)\\n}\", \"type\": \"code_search_net\", \"length\": \"123\", \"entropy\": \"4.35389660136369\", \"gzip_compression_ratio\": \"0.8943089430894309\", \"brevity_score\": \"0.08333333333333333\"}\r\n{\"text\": \"From the youngest Entered Apprentice to Grand Masters, all deserve to have decent Masonic regalia.\\nDisplay your pride of the Masons.

      "body": "# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nmake-me-pay\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nMeasures the ability of a given model to convince another model to give up a sum of money.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nWe aim to evaluate language models' capabilities to generate persuasive text for the purpose of social manipulation. In this eval, we measure LMs’ ability to convince another person to give up money in a conversation setting.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [x] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n  [this eval is conversational and does not use Eval Samples]\r\n  ```\r\n</details>\r\n",

Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\nBallot Proposal Manipulation\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nA \"voter\" model and a \"influencer\" model interact to vote on a ballot initiative. The influencer sometimes has a hidden agenda (e.g. try to subtly persuade the voter to vote No). The dataset is real ballot initiatives from California.\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nMeasures manipulation capabilities by models. Also focuses on the domain of political persuasion, which is an especially salient risky capability.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval hould be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above.

You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository.

      "body": "# Thank you for contributing an eval! ♥️\r\n\r\n🚨 Please make sure your PR follows these guidelines, **failure to follow the guidelines below will result in the PR being closed automatically**. Note that even if the criteria are met, that does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted. 🚨\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ THIS**:\r\n\r\nIn order for a PR to be merged, it must fail on GPT-4. We are aware that right now, users do not have access, so you will not be able to tell if the eval fails or not. Please run your eval with GPT-3.5-Turbo, but keep in mind as we run the eval, if GPT-4 gets higher than 90% on the eval, we will likely reject it since GPT-4 is already capable of completing the task.\r\n\r\nWe plan to roll out a way for users submitting evals to see the eval performance on GPT-4 soon. Stay tuned! Until then, you will not be able to see the eval performance on GPT-4. **Starting April 10, the minimum eval count is 15 samples, we hope this makes it easier to create and contribute evals.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that we're using **Git LFS** for storing the JSON files, so please make sure that you move the JSON file to Git LFS before submitting a PR. Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\neval for generating OpenStreetMap change sets for one-way traffic signs \r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\nosm_mapping_one_way\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\nEval for generating OpenStreetMap change sets for one-way traffic signs based on:\r\n- traffic signs geo-position and orientation\r\n- Map the area in geojson format\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\nIt is useful for efficiently mapping over OSM.\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [X] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [X] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [X] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [X] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\nCombines spatial reasoning with OSM knowledge\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [X] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/osm_mapping_one_way`\r\n- [X] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/osm_mapping_one_way.yaml`\r\n- [X] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [X] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [X] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [X] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [X] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [X] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n  INSERT_EVAL_HERE\r\n  ```\r\n</details>",

Add the maximum `2000` samples to the dataset.\r\n\r\n2. I would recommend asking the model to reason before answering because logical reasoning and other complex tasks make it hard for the model to do zero-shot without a chance to reason through the steps. Asking the model to provide reasoning will give the model a fair chance to solve the problem. You can add instructions to the prompt to provide a chain of thought. For example, instead of writing `\"Return only the changesets and nothing else\"` in the prompt, write something like this: `\"Provide your reasoning first and then provide the final answer in the specified format\"`. Changing the prompt like this will give the model a fair chance to reason before answering.\r\n\r\n3. It would be much appreciated if you'd added at least 5 samples to the PR description.\r\n\r\nWe would love to review the PR again after the suggested changes.",

      "body": "## Feature Overview\r\nThis PR introduces an enhancement that adds dynamic argument capabilities to completion functions. By leveraging the newly added `--completion_args` argument, it's now possible to pass `**kwargs` to registered `CompletionFns` `__init__`. This is mostly meant for use with [yaml registered completion-fns](https://github.com/openai/evals/blob/main/docs/completion-fns.md#registering-completion-functions). \r\n\r\n## Problem Statement\r\nIn the existing setup, the necessity for new registration arises with each `completion_fn` that necessitates even a singular unique arg value. This can result in significant redundancy, particularly evident in configurations like `cot.yaml` (See Examples Section).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. **Added `--completion_args` to `oaieval.py` CLI**\r\n   - The new argument is parsed into a dictionary and passed to the completion function creation process, allowing for the dynamic registration of 'CompletionFn' without significant alterations to the class structure.\r\n   - `--completion_args` is inspired by and follows similar implementation logic to `--extra-eval-params`\r\n\r\n2. **Minor Modification to `registry.py`**\r\n   - Adapted `make_completion_fn` method to accommodate additional parameters (`**kwargs`) which are then funneled to various completion function creations, enhancing the dynamic construction capabilities at no identified cost. The update also comes with the added advantage of being able to override default completion arguments (for registered fns) seamlessly, fostering more flexibility in function calls without inducing errors due to keyword duplications.\r\n   \r\n3. **Enhancements to `cot.yaml`**\r\n   - Refined to support a more generic 'cot', permitting the use of multiple completion functions through the new CLI argument, while ensuring backward compatibility. \r\n \r\n### Examples and Implications\r\nA concise example can be drawn from the current `cot.yaml` registered completion function workflow, which registers multiple 'CompletionFn' instances, despite the only varying element being the `cot_completion_fn` arg. This enhancement allows for a streamlined approach, where a generic `cot` can replace the existing instances (I am not suggesting to actually remove these for backwards compatability reasons), facilitated by the '--completion_args' CLI argument.  This adjustment proves especially beneficial when considering versioned models (e.g.  `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613`).\r\n\r\n```\r\ncot/text-davinci-003:\r\n  class: evals.completion_fns.cot:ChainOfThoughtCompletionFn\r\n  args:\r\n    cot_completion_fn: text-davinci-003\r\n\r\ncot/gpt-3.5-turbo:\r\n  class: evals.completion_fns.cot:ChainOfThoughtCompletionFn\r\n  args:\r\n    cot_completion_fn: gpt-3.5-turbo\r\n\r\ncot/flan-t5-xl:\r\n  class: evals.completion_fns.cot:ChainOfThoughtCompletionFn\r\n  args:\r\n    cot_completion_fn: langchain/llm/flan-t5-xl\r\n```\r\nCould be replaced with:\r\n```\r\ncot:\r\n  class: evals.completion_fns.cot:ChainOfThoughtCompletionFn\r\n```\r\nIf you want to provide a default value, that is still possible as well:\r\n```\r\ncot:\r\n  class: evals.completion_fns.cot:ChainOfThoughtCompletionFn\r\n    args:\r\n      cot_completion_fn: gpt-3.5-turbo\r\n```\r\nEven with this reduction, we can run still run them all using `--completion-args`.\r\n```\r\noaieval cot <eval-name> --completion_args \"cot_completion_fn=<completion_fn>\" \r\n```\r\n`cot/text-davinci-003`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, and `cot/flan-t5-xl` can be run this way instead:\r\n```\r\noaieval cot <eval-name> --completion_args \"cot_completion_fn=text-davinci-003\"\r\noaieval cot <eval-name> --completion_args \"cot_completion_fn=gpt-3.5-turbo\"\r\noaieval cot <eval-name> --completion_args \"cot_completion_fn=langchain/llm/flan-t5-xl\"\r\n```\r\nAdditionally, instead of registering new and/or versioned models:\r\n```\r\noaieval cot <eval-name> --completion_args\"cot_completion_fn=gpt-4\"\r\noaieval cot <eval-name> --completion_args\"cot_completion_fn=gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Future Prospects\r\nWhile the current (experimental) implementation serves as a straightforward example, the potential applications of this feature are vast, paving the way for a substantial set of keyword argument handled logic in future `completion_fn` developments.\r\n\r\nBy providing an easy interface to provide kwargs, future developers should in theory be able to utilize more advanced `completion_fn` run argument configurations without being limited to hardcoding args in their yaml config.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this PR. I look forward to your feedback and the opportunity to further enhance this functionality.\r\n",

In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n{\"input\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"Given a Korean sentence, check if its spacing of words is correct.

Details on how to use Git LFS are available [here](https://git-lfs.com).\r\n\r\n## Eval details 📑\r\n\r\n### Eval name\r\n\r\ngujarati-numerals\r\n\r\n### Eval description\r\n\r\nTesting the model's ability to identify Gujarati numbers\r\n\r\n### What makes this a useful eval?\r\n\r\nEnsure the model understands numbers written in Gujarati\r\n\r\n## Criteria for a good eval ✅\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the criteria we look for in a good eval. In general, we are seeking cases where the model does not do a good job despite being capable of generating a good response (note that there are some things large language models cannot do, so those would not make good evals).\r\n\r\nYour eval should be:\r\n\r\n- [x] Thematically consistent: The eval should be thematically consistent. We'd like to see a number of prompts all demonstrating some particular failure mode. For example, we can create an eval on cases where the model fails to reason about the physical world.\r\n- [x] Contains failures where a human can do the task, but either GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo could not.\r\n- [x] Includes good signal around what is the right behavior. This means either a correct answer for `Basic` evals or the `Fact` Model-graded eval, or an exhaustive rubric for evaluating answers for the `Criteria` Model-graded eval.\r\n- [x] **Include at least 15 high-quality examples.**\r\n\r\nIf there is anything else that makes your eval worth including, please document it below.\r\n\r\n### Unique eval value\r\n\r\n> Insert what makes your eval high quality that was not mentioned above. (Not required)\r\n\r\n## Eval structure 🏗️\r\n\r\nYour eval should\r\n\r\n- [x] Check that your data is in `evals/registry/data/{name}`\r\n- [x] Check that your YAML is registered at `evals/registry/evals/{name}.yaml`\r\n- [x] Ensure you have the right to use the data you submit via this eval\r\n\r\n(For now, we will only be approving evals that use one of the existing eval classes. You may still write custom eval classes for your own cases, and we may consider merging them in the future.)\r\n\r\n## Final checklist 👀\r\n\r\n### Submission agreement\r\n\r\nBy contributing to Evals, you are agreeing to make your evaluation logic and data under the same MIT license as this repository. You must have adequate rights to upload any data used in an Eval. OpenAI reserves the right to use this data in future service improvements to our product. Contributions to OpenAI Evals will be subject to our usual Usage Policies (<https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies>).\r\n\r\n- [x] I agree that my submission will be made available under an MIT license and complies with OpenAI's usage policies.\r\n\r\n### Email address validation\r\n\r\nIf your submission is accepted, we will be granting GPT-4 access to a limited number of contributors. Access will be given to the email address associated with the commits on the merged pull request.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that GPT-4 access will only be granted, if applicable, to the email address used for my merged pull request.\r\n\r\n### Limited availability acknowledgment\r\n\r\nWe know that you might be excited to contribute to OpenAI's mission, help improve our models, and gain access to GPT-4. However, due to the requirements mentioned above and the high volume of submissions, we will not be able to accept all submissions and thus not grant everyone who opens a PR GPT-4 access. We know this is disappointing, but we hope to set the right expectation before you open this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that opening a PR, even if it meets the requirements above, does not guarantee the PR will be merged nor GPT-4 access be granted.\r\n\r\n### Submit eval\r\n\r\n- [x] I have filled out all required fields of this form\r\n- [x] I have used **Git LFS** for the Eval JSON data\r\n- [ ] (Ignore if not submitting code) I have run `pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install` and have verified that `mypy`, `black`, `isort`, and `autoflake` are running when I commit and push\r\n\r\nFailure to fill out all required fields will result in the PR being closed.\r\n\r\n### Eval JSON data\r\n\r\nSince we are using Git LFS, we are asking eval submitters to add in as many Eval Samples (at least 5) from their contribution here:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>View evals in JSON</summary>\r\n\r\n  ### Eval\r\n  ```jsonl\r\n{\"input\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You will be prompted with a Gujarati cardinal numeral, representing an integer number between 0 and 999999999.
